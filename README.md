# Injecting Imbalance Sensitivity for Multi-Task Learning
This is the implementation of our IJCAI'25 paper "[Injecting Imbalance Sensitivity for Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08006)". In this paper, we highlight the importance of imbalance for MTL, and develop an imbalance-sensitive approach.
